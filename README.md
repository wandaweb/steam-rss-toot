# steam-rss-toot
Mastodon bot that toots articles from Steam's RSS feed.

The bot is currently running as [@steamnews@pogs.cafe](https://pogs.cafe/@steamnews).

For the bot to work, the file `keys.json.sample` should be renamed to `keys.json` and needs to contain the Mastodon API URL and access token.

Install dependencies by running
```
npm i
```

Start the bot by running
```
node main.js
```
